# 2. Description
The program is intended as a tool in coordination chemistry to evaluate the point group symmetry of a coordination complex.
The coordination complex is given as file containing the coordinates and labels for all atoms in the coordination complex. 
The first atom in the series is used to center the complex such that it lies in origo.
Then a set of point groups is manually chosen for evaluation on the complex. 
The evaluation is done by comparing the euclidean distance between all coordinates in the input coordinates with new coordinates generated from the symmetry operations within the point group that is used for evaluation.

An autonomous assignment of the principal axis is performed prior to the evalution. This assures that the input structure is always aligned optimally with the symmetry axis used for evaluation.

The output of the program is the symmetry deviation values provided for each selected symmetry operations, deviation values of individual symmetry operations within each point group, and new coordinate files for each structure that has been generated by the symmetry operations.

# 3. How to install
The Program is written in the python environment Spyder and it is intended to be used in this or a similar coding environment. 
The program therefore need no formal installation if Spyder is installed: https://www.spyder-ide.org/

When the program is downloaded it is downloaded as a folder containing two python scripts entitled: "CSoM_Program.py" and "CSoM_functions.py" and a folder containing information on all available point groups entitled: "Operations". 

+ "CSoM_Program.py" is the main file and is used to run the program.
+ "CSoM_functions.py" contains all custom functions used by the program.

The "CSoM_Program.py" is opened in a python environment and must always be in the same folders as "CSoM_functions.py" and "Operations".

To run the code the following packages need to be installed: 

+ numpy
+ math
+ re
+ pandas
+ scipy
+ datetime


# 4. How to Use
When the program is open in a python environment, it can be run by inserting the required inputs. Here we go through all inputs as they are written in the program file:

The structure file required to run the program is an .xyz file commonly used and generated with programs such as VESTA: https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/download.html. It contains the labels and coordinates of all atoms in the complex
**The central atom in the complex, is the first atom listed.** This is the coordinate that will be used as Origo in the calculations, if a manual coordinate is not selected.

Examples of input files are provided in this recepoire. 

Inputs for the structure file is required:
 + mypath: the path to the folder where your structure file is located.
 + all_structure
 + structures_selected
