# 2. Description
The program is intended as a tool in coordination chemistry to evaluate the point group symmetry of a coordination complex.
The coordination complex is given as file containing the coordinates and labels for all atoms in the coordination complex. 
The first atom in the series is used to center the complex such that it lies in origo.
Then a set of point groups is manually chosen for evaluation on the complex. 
The evaluation is done by comparing the euclidean distance between all coordinates in the input coordinates with new coordinates generated from the symmetry operations within the point group that is used for evaluation.

An autonomous assignment of the principal axis is performed prior to the evalution. This assures that the input structure is always aligned optimally with the symmetry axis used for evaluation.

The output of the program is the symmetry deviation values provided for each selected symmetry operations, deviation values of individual symmetry operations within each point group, and new coordinate files for each structure that has been generated by the symmetry operations. 


# 3. How to install
The Program is written in the python environment Spyder and it is intended to be used in this or a similar coding environment. 
The program therefore need no formal installation if Spyder is installed: https://www.spyder-ide.org/

To run the code the following packages need to be installed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item numpy
  \item math
  \item re
  \item pandas
  \item scipy
  \item datetime
